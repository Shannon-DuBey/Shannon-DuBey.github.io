			<p>
				I have more than 15 years of experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & jQuery from both a freelance web design and consultant perspective. I work hard to stay current on existing as well as emerging technologies and inorporate them into my work where ever possible. My recent work experience also includes AngularJS, Bootstrap, Ajax, JSON, Angular2 (ng2), React, LESS, SASS, CSS Transitions & Translations, Gulp, Bower, REST api consumption, and various Responsive Design technologies. This combined with my previous 18 year career in IT services covering everything from level 1 help desk up to Network/Server administration make me a very well rounded technical resource and an ideal candidate for a wide range of projects.

				<span class="sectionTitle">The unintended career path:</span>
				<br />
				I grew up around computers (back before that was a common thing) but gratuated high school bound for a 4 year university to study Psychology. About a year into the program I decided it just wasn't a good fit for me and fell back on my computer troubleshooting skills for employment while I figured out where to go next. Turns out, that first computer tech/help desk job was the beginnign of a career. I later graduated with a dual associates degree in Computer Networking Technology for Novell & Cisco plus a certificate in Microsoft (all the heavy hiters) and spent roughly 18 years working my way up that IT Services ladder to a Network/Server admin post.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="sectionTitle">Career Phase two:</span>
				<br />
				After 15 years in the world of IT Services changing passwords and rebooting servers and network gear gets a little old! By that time I had spent almost 10 years 'playing with' web development in my spare time as a creative outlett and soon discovered I was good at it. So, I found a 4 year degree that would let me major in Web Development and perhapse start down a new career path. Thanks to many of my previous courses translating directly to the new program and the fast pace of an online degree curiculum I was able to earn my Bachelor of Web Development in about 2.5 years. Then I did what every beginning web developer does, freelance! I already had a few built in clients from days prior to my degree. Technically I began freelancing in 1999 when web pages were static HTML and CSS was just a beta idea. Those clients, some of whom paid, built up my confidence and portfolio allowing me to leave the security of my IT Services career behind and venture off into the world of full time web development in early 2012.

				<span class="sectionTitle">But wait there is more:</span>
				<br />
				Besides being a formet IT Services geek and current Web Development Guru I am also a painter, photographer, writer, geocacher, snowboarder, puzzle solver, and all around fun to hang with kind of girl. Oh, in case the name didn't give it away, yes I am one of those few developers who happens to also be female. We are rare in some places, an up and coming section of the workforce, but we do exist. Fear not, I have spent my entire working life keeping up with and hanging out with 'the boys' and thus far have never run into any issues. We get along great and some would say, I fit right in no mater the group dynamic. I'm just cool like that!
